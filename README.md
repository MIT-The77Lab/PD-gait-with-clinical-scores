# Human Pose-Based Parkinson's Disease Dataset

This repository provides access to **Human Pose-Based PD Dataset**, a comprehensive collection of OpenPose skeleton data from Parkinson's Disease patients and healthy controls for motor assessment and classification research.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**Skeleton-Based PD Dataset** consists of skeleton keypoint data extracted from video recordings, annotated for:
- 107 `Parkinson's Disease patients`
- 38 `Healthy Controls`
- Multiple recording sessions per patient

This dataset addresses the challenge of **automated PD detection** using human pose-based analysis, captured under various recording conditions and durations.
